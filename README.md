Project Title: Mini Code Snippet Repository for Educational Purposes
Project Overview:

A university professor has requested the creation of a public GitHub repository containing a collection of beginner-friendly code snippets designed to help students understand fundamental programming concepts. The snippets should be well-commented, easy to read, and not rely on any external libraries. This repository will serve as a valuable resource for students and educators alike.

## Introduction
This repository contains beginner-friendly code snippets to help students understand fundamental programming concepts. 
Each snippet is simple, self-contained, and well-commented for easy learning.

## Snippets Included
1. **variables.py** - Demonstrates variables and data types (int, float, string, boolean).
2. **loops.py** - Examples of control structures (for loop, while loop).
3. **functions.py** - Shows how to define and use functions.
4. **basic_io.py** - Demonstrates basic input and output operations.
5. **arrays.py** - Shows how to use arrays (lists in Python).

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the snippet files.
4. Run a snippet with the command:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

For example:
```bash
python variables.py
```

Each snippet runs independently and demonstrates a specific concept.
